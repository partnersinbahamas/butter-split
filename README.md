## 🗓 1. Create an event
Every calculation starts with an event. This can be anything:  

- ✈️ a trip with friends  
- 🍝 a dinner out together  
- 🏝 a party or a vacation  

---

## 👥 2. Add participants
List everyone who is taking part.  
They can be your friends, colleagues, or family members.  
It doesn’t matter who actually pays — everyone will be included.  

---

## 💸 3. Add expenses
Record all the expenses for the event:  

- 🙋‍♂️ who paid  
- 🫰 how much  
- ❓ and what for  

---

## ✅ 4. Get a fair result
Butter Split automatically calculates the balance, and who needs to pay back whom.  

This way, all participants share the costs **fairly and transparently** — without complicated calculations or misunderstandings.
